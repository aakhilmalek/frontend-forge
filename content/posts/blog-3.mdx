CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. Some CSS properties are used more frequently because they handle essential aspects of web design. Here’s a list of some of the most commonly used CSS properties:

1. **`color`**: Sets the color of the text. It can accept predefined color names, hexadecimal, RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA values.
   ```css
   color: red;
   color: #ff0000;
   color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
   ```

2. **`background-color`**: Sets the background color of an element.
   ```css
   background-color: blue;
   ```

3. **`font-size`**: Adjusts the size of the font.
   ```css
   font-size: 16px;
   ```

4. **`font-family`**: Sets the typeface for the text.
   ```css
   font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
   ```

5. **`border`**: Adds a border around elements. It’s shorthand for `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color`.
   ```css
   border: 1px solid black;
   ```

6. **`padding`**: Controls the space between the border and the content inside an element.
   ```css
   padding: 10px;
   ```

7. **`margin`**: Sets the space between elements.
   ```css
   margin: 20px;
   ```

8. **`width`** and **`height`**: Specifies the width and height of elements.
   ```css
   width: 100px;
   height: 50px;
   ```

9. **`display`**: Defines how an element is displayed on the page. Common values include `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `flex`.
   ```css
   display: flex;
   ```

10. **`position`**: Specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
    ```css
    position: relative;
    ```

11. **`overflow`**: Specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
    ```css
    overflow: hidden;
    ```

12. **`text-align`**: Aligns text horizontally within an element.
    ```css
    text-align: center;
    ```

13. **`opacity`**: Sets the opacity level for an element, making it transparent.
    ```css
    opacity: 0.5;
    ```

14. **`box-shadow`**: Applies shadow effects around an element’s frame.
    ```css
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px grey;
    ```

15. **`border-radius`**: Rounds the corners of an element’s border.
    ```css
    border-radius: 8px;
    ```

16. **`transition`**: Allows you to change property values smoothly (over a given duration).
    ```css
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    ```

17. **`flex`**: A shorthand for setting `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` in one declaration. It’s essential for flexible box layouts.
    ```css
    flex: 1;
    ```

These properties are foundational to most CSS styling tasks. Understanding and using them effectively can significantly influence the appearance and layout of a webpage.
